            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Texas Hold 'Em</b> is the most popular form of poker. This is one of those games that is more complex than actually playing. While there is an element of luck involved, it requires a great amount of skill to win and end up with <b>as many chips as possible</b> </p>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">All players are dealt <b>2 cards</b> face down, followed by <b>5 cards</b> face up. 
            Players must make the best possible 5 card poker hand using the 5 <b>community cards</b> and their own face down <b>hole cards</b>.
            The best 5 card poker hand wins the hand and receives the <b>pot</b>.At various stages players <b>bet</b> against each other on the value
            of their hands. A player can <b>fold</b> their hand at any stage. Each betting stage is identical, and there are 4 stages of betting as listed below. They have fancy names but don't let it confuse you, you can think of them as stages 1-4. Once the betting stage is resolved, the next stage of the hand starts. </p>

            <h3>1. Pre-Flop</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">There is a <b>round of betting</b> once all players have received their 2 hole cards known as the <b>pre-flop</b></p>
            <h3>2. Flop</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">3 cards are then dealt face up. This is called the <b>flop</b>. Another round of betting proceeds, starting with the player on the left of the dealer. (The dealer is just a position)</p>
            <h3>3. Turn</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">1 more card is then dealt face up. This is called the <b>turn</b>. Again, there is another round of betting, starting with the player on the left of the dealer.</p>
            <h3>4. River</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The 5th and last card is then dealt face up. This is called the <b>river</b>>. There is one final round of betting before all cards are turned face up - the <b>showdown</b>.</p>
            <h2>Winning the Pot</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The player with the best 5 card poker hand wins the pot with all the bets made at each previous round. A player may also win the pot before the showdown if all other players fold.The player with the best 5 card poker hand wins the pot with all the bets made at each previous round. A player may also win the pot before the showdown if all other players fold. Poker is not a game of chance but one where the twin elements of fortune and skill are both required to win. Over time, the application of skill will virtually eliminate the variance of luck.</p>
