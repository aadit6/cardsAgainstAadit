            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Texas Hold 'Em</b> is the most popular form of poker. This is one of those games that is more complex than actually playing. While there is an element of luck involved, it requires a great amount of skill to win and end up with <b>as many chips as possible</b> </p>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">All players are dealt <b>2 cards</b> face down, followed by <b>5 cards</b> face up. 
            Players must make the best possible 5 card poker hand using the 5 <b>community cards</b> and their own face down <b>hole cards</b>.
            The best 5 card poker hand wins the hand and receives the <b>pot</b>.At various stages players <b>bet</b> against each other on the value
            of their hands. A player can <b>fold</b> their hand at any stage. Each betting stage is identical, and there are 4 stages of betting as listed below. They have fancy names but don't let it confuse you, you can think of them as stages 1-4. Once the betting stage is resolved, the next stage of the hand starts. </p>

            <h3>1. Pre-Flop</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">There is a <b>round of betting</b> once all players have received their 2 hole cards known as the <b>pre-flop</b></p>
            <h3>2. Flop</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">3 cards are then dealt face up. This is called the <b>flop</b>. Another round of betting proceeds, starting with the player on the left of the dealer. (The dealer is just a position)</p>
            <h3>3. Turn</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">1 more card is then dealt face up. This is called the <b>turn</b>. Again, there is another round of betting, starting with the player on the left of the dealer.</p>
            <h3>4. River</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The 5th and last card is then dealt face up. This is called the <b>river</b>>. There is one final round of betting before all cards are turned face up - the <b>showdown</b>.</p>
            <h2>Winning the Pot</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The player with the best 5 card poker hand wins the pot with all the bets made at each previous round. A player may also win the pot before the showdown if all other players fold.The player with the best 5 card poker hand wins the pot with all the bets made at each previous round.
